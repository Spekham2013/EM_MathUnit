* Formulas
** Conversion of voltage to power in dBm
$$dBm = a \cdot V_{power} + b$$

Where a is the slope of the power detector and b is the offset.

** dBm to watts
$$P = 10^{\frac{dBm}{10}}$$

** Electric field
$$|E| = \sqrt{ P \cdot 120 \pi}$$

** Magnetic field
$$|H| = \frac{|E|}{120 \pi}$$

** Power density
